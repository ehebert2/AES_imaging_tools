This is just to help me remember what fields the params struct contains.

	channels: 	how many channels
	mainChannel: 	channel referenced for motion correction
	splitChannels:	different masks for each channel
	bidirectional: 	if bidirectional slow axis scanning was used
	bidiShift: 	shift on upper half of image to compensate for time delay in bidirectional scanning
	volume:		Is the stack a 3D volume
	slices:		For volumes. Number of slices per volume.
	multiVid: 	whether or not multiple videos are to be processed
	splitFolders: 	whether or not to split the output into folders for each video
	mtn: 		whether or not to do motion correction
	mtnIntlWndw: 	number of frames used to form template for motion correction
	mtnWndw: 	temporal gaussian averaged window for motion correction
	compress: 	whether or not to set pixels outside imaging roi's to 0 and compress output video
	saveMasks: 	whether or not to save masks used for data analysis
	saveVid:	whether or not to save the output video
	zeroVid: 	whether or not to subtract video by background (value outside of laser exposure regions)
	bgTrace: 	save average and stdev of pixels outside laser exposure regions for each frame
	aesTrace: 	save pixel values inside each AES ROI
	smplTrace: 	save pixel values inside each sample ROI (after motion correction if using)
	zeroTrace:	subtrace background mean from sample and aes traces before saving.
	mtnTrace: 	save displacement in pixel units of rigid motion correction for each frame
	mtnOverlap: 	save boolean of each sample ROI for each frame determining if the sample ROI lies within the AES ROI region after motion correction.
	sptlWndw: 	spatial blur (1/e^2 radius) applied to images for motion registration (only used during motion correction, not applied to any saved video)
	passes: 	number of motion correction passes for the whole video
	intlPasses:	number of motion correction passes for the template
	fft: 		whether or not to use k-space for cross-correlation for motion detection
	roiAes: 	AES ROI masks
	roiSmpl: 	Sample ROI masks
	numRoiAes:	Number of AesRois
	numRoiSmpl:	Number of Sample Rois
	expMask:	exposure mask
	aesNames:	AES ROI names
	smplNames:	Sample ROI names
	proj:		save projection of each channel
	dim:		dimension of images (optional if enough other information is present)
