This is just to help me remember what fields the params struct contains.

	% Variables describing input video structure
	channels: 	how many channels
	mainChannel: 	channel referenced for motion correction
	splitChannels:	different masks for each channel
	bidirectional: 	if even and odd frames are sampled differently
	yBidirectional: if each frame was scanned bidirectionally on the y-axis
	zBidirectional: if the volume was scanned bidirectionally through z
	bidiShift: 	shift on upper half of image to compensate for time delay in bidirectional scanning
	volume:		Is the stack a 3D volume
	slices:		For volumes. Number of slices per volume.
	dim:		dimension of images (optional if enough other information is present)
	
	% Variables describing what is saved to file after processing
	multiVid: 	whether or not multiple videos are to be processed
	proj:		save projection of each channel
	saveMasks: 	whether or not to save masks used for data analysis
	saveVid:	whether or not to save the output video
	compress: 	whether or not to set pixels outside imaging roi's to 0 and compress output video
	fillBG:		fill in pixels outside AES regions with average of pixels in AES regions but outside sample regions
	zeroVid: 	whether or not to subtract video by electrical background (average value outside of laser exposure regions)
	zeroVidFl:	whether or not to subtract video by flourescence background (average value in AES exposure regions but outside sample regions)
	bgTrace: 	save average and stdev of pixels outside laser exposure regions for each frame
	flTrace:	save average and stdev of pixels in AES regions but outside sample regions
	aesTrace: 	save pixel values inside each AES ROI
	smplTrace: 	save pixel values inside each sample ROI (after motion correction if using)
	zeroTrace:	subtract background mean from sample and aes traces before saving.
	zeroTraceFl:	subtract flourescence background mean from sample and aes traces before saving.
	mtnTrace: 	save displacement in pixel units of rigid motion correction for each frame
	mtnOverlap: 	save boolean of each sample ROI for each frame determining if the sample ROI lies within the AES ROI region after motion correction.
	checkAcc:	check if frame motion exceeds threshold acceleration.
	maxAcc:		max acceleration of frame (px/fr^2) for mtnOverlap boolean (motion correction can undershoot for high acceleration due to temporal blurring).
	
	% Variables describing motion correction (if using)
	mtn: 		whether or not to do motion correction
	mtnIntlWndw: 	number of frames used to form template for motion correction
	mtnWndw: 	temporal gaussian averaged window for motion correction
	sptlWndw: 	spatial blur (1/e^2 radius) applied to images for motion registration (only used during motion correction, not applied to any saved video)
	passes: 	number of motion correction passes for the whole video
	intlPasses:	number of motion correction passes for the template
	fft: 		whether or not to use k-space for cross-correlation for motion detection

	% Masks used to filter and process frames of video
	roiAes: 	AES ROI masks
	roiSmpl: 	Sample ROI masks
	numRoiAes:	Number of AesRois
	numRoiSmpl:	Number of Sample Rois
	expMask:	exposure mask
	aesNames:	AES ROI names
	smplNames:	Sample ROI names
	
	% Variables used to reorder slices in video
	reslice:	if volume slices need to be rearranged for output
	resliceMap:	3d matrix [input slice][input channel][output slice, output channel] mapping slice order read in to write out
	slicesOut:	number of slices out
	channelsOut:	number of channels out
