# AES_imaging_tools
Tools for processing imaging data produced using adaptive excitation. This includes three installable matlab apps. 
* __Motion Correction App:__ The primary application use for motion correcting videos with AES patterns and extracting trace data.
* __Mask App:__ Used for producing binary masks when generating AES patterns. This is useful for producing the masks used for segmentation in the Motion Correction App, but not necessary.
* __Trace Viewer App:__ Used for getting a quick overview of output from the Motion Correction App. This is not typically the final step of data analysis; however, it can be useful for understanding the data put out by the Motion Correction App before deciding whether a more thorough analysis will be useful.

## Motion Correction Tool
This is the primary tool present in this repository. A more complete description of the tool, necessary inputs, and required outputs is included in the "Motion Correction App Manual" word document.
