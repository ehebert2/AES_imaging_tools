.bin output files from the ROI management application contain pixel info for an ROI over the course of a time stack

The structure is as follows: ([uint 32 bit] number of frames) ([uint 32 bit] number of pixels) ([int 32 bit] a: bit depth of data) ([uint 32 bit] b: 1 for signed, 0 for unsigned data) ([a.b] frame 1 pixel 1) ([a.b] frame 1 pixel 2) ([a.b] frame 1 pixel 3) ... ([a.b] frame 2 pixel 1) ([a.b] frame 2 pixel 2) ([a.b] frame 2 pixel 3) ...

Example: if you have 3 pixels in an roi over 5 frames formatted as 16 bit unsigned integers, you could write them as:

1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9
10 11 12
13 14 15

in the .bin file, it would become:

5 3 16 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

The AESFile class has methods for reading and writing these files more easily.
